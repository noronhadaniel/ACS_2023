    :param int address: The I2C device address. Defaults to :const:`0x60`

    **Quickstart: Importing and using the MPL3115A2**

        Here is an example of using the :class:`MPL3115A2` class.
        First you will need to import the libraries to use the sensor

        .. code-block:: python

            import board
            import adafruit_mpl3115a2

        Once this is done you can define your `board.I2C` object and define your sensor object

        .. code-block:: python

            i2c = board.I2C()   # uses board.SCL and board.SDA
            sensor = adafruit_mpl3115a2.MPL3115A2(i2c)

        Now you have access to the :attr:`temperature`, :attr:`pressure`
        and :attr:`altitude` attributes

        .. code-block:: python

            temperature = sensor.temperature
            pressure = sensor.pressure
            altitude = sensor.altitude
